# <H1> Level-indicator </H1>

This is the model-based software design course project of the year 2020/2021.

The goal of this project is to implement a level indicator, which is composed of the following elements: 
1. Ultrasonic Ranging Sensor
2. Ranging Estimator

<h2> The ultrasonic ranging sensor </H2>

The sensor is equivalent to HC-SR04:
- It provides 2cm - 400cm non-contact measurement function
- The ranging accuracy can reach to 3mm
